<td ><h1><u>About The Alfred Nobel</u></h1>
<p><marquee direction="up">Alfred Nobel was born in Stockholm on October 21, 1833.
His father Immanuel Nobel was an engineer and inventor who built bridges and buildings in Stockholm.
In connection with his construction work Immanuel Nobel also experimented with different techniques for blasting rocks.
Alfred's mother, born Andriette Ahlsell, came from a wealthy family. Due to misfortunes in his construction work caused by the loss of some barges of building material, Immanuel Nobel was forced into bankruptcy the same year Alfred Nobel was born. 
In 1837 Immanuel Nobel left Stockholm and his family to start a new career in Finland and in Russia. 
To support the family, Andriette Nobel started a grocery store which provided a modest income. Meanwhile Immanuel Nobel was successful in his new enterprise in St.
 Petersburg, Russia. He started a mechanical workshop which provided equipment for the Russian army and he also convinced the Tsar and his generals that naval mines could be used to block enemy naval ships from threatening the city.
The naval mines designed by Immanuel Nobel were simple devices consisting of submerged wooden casks filled with gunpowder. 
Anchored below the surface of the Gulf of Finland, they effectively deterred the British Royal Navy from moving into firing range of St. 
Petersburg during the Crimean war (1853-1856). 
Immanuel Nobel was also a pioneer in arms manufacture and in designing steam engines.
Successful in his industrial and business ventures, Immanuel Nobel was able, in 1842, to bring his family to St. Petersburg. 
There, his sons were given a first class education by private teachers. The training included natural sciences, languages and literature.
 By the age of 17 Alfred Nobel was fluent in Swedish, Russian, French, English and German. His primary interests were in English literature and poetry as well as in chemistry and physics.
 Alfred's father, who wanted his sons to join his enterprise as engineers, disliked Alfred's interest in poetry and found his son rather introverted. In order to widen Alfred's horizons his father sent him abroad for further training in chemical engineering. During a two year period Alfred Nobel visited Sweden, Germany, France and the United States. 
In Paris, the city he came to like best, he worked in the private laboratory of Professor T. J. Pelouze, a famous chemist. There he met the young Italian chemist Ascanio Sobrero who, three years earlier, had invented nitroglycerine, a highly explosive liquid. 
Nitroglycerine was produced by mixing glycerine with sulfuric and nitric acid. 
It was considered too dangerous to be of any practical use. Although its explosive power greatly exceeded that of gunpowder, the liquid would explode in a very unpredictable manner if subjected to heat and pressure. Alfred Nobel became very interested in nitroglycerine and how it could be put to practical use in construction work.
 He also realized that the safety problems had to be solved and a method had to be developed for the controlled detonation of nitroglycerine. In the United States he visited John Ericsson, the Swedish-American engineer who had developed the screw propeller for ships. In 1852 Alfred Nobel was asked to come back and work in the family enterprise which was booming because of its deliveries to the Russian army. 
Together with his father he performed experiments to develop nitroglycerine as a commercially and technically useful explosive. As the war ended and conditions changed, Immanuel Nobel was again forced into bankruptcy. Immanuel and two of his sons, Alfred and Emil, left St.
 Petersburg together and returned to Stockholm. His other two sons, Robert and Ludvig, remained in St. Petersburg. With some difficulties they managed to salvage the family enterprise and then went on to develop the oil industry in the southern part of the Russian empire. 
They were very successful and became some of the wealthiest persons of their time.</marquee>

<h1><u>Award Process</u></h1>
<a name="#N">
<h2>Nomination</h2>
<p><marquee direction="top">Nomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3,000 individuals, usually in September the year before the prizes are awarded. 
These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize, inquiries are also sent to governments, former Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. 
The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award.The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names.
The nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize. All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize.
</marquee>
</p>
<a name="#s">
<h2>Selection</h2>
<marquee>
The Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields. 
This, along with the list of preliminary candidates, is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions.
The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote. 
Their decision, which cannot be appealed, is announced immediately after the vote.
A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award.
Except for the Peace Prize, which can be awarded to institutions, the awards can only be given to individuals.
If the Peace Prize is not awarded, the money is split among the scientific prizes. This has happened 19 times so far.</p>
</marquee>
<a name="#a">
<h3>Posthumous nominations</h3>
<marquee>
<p>Although posthumous nominations are not presently permitted, individuals who died in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize. 
This has occurred twice: the 1931 Literature Prize awarded to Erik Axel Karlfeldt, and the 1961 Peace Prize awarded to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld. Since 1974, laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement. 
There has been one laureate, William Vickrey, who in 1996 died after the prize (in Economics) was announced but before it could be presented.[51] On 3 October 2011, the laureates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine were announced; however, the committee was not aware that one of the laureates, Ralph M. Steinman, had died three days earlier. 
The committee was debating about Steinman's prize, since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously. The committee later decided that as the decision to award Steinman the prize "was made in good faith", it would remain unchanged

<h1><u>Award Money</u></h1>
<p><marquee direction="down">
The laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes, in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded.
The amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year. 
The purse has increased since the 1980s, when the prize money was 880 000 SEK (c. 2.6 million SEK, US$350 000, or €295,000 today) per prize.
 In 2009, the monetary award was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million, €950,000).[90][91] In June 2012, it was lowered to 8 million SEK.
If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients.
If there are three, the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally, or awarding one-half to one recipient and one-quarter to each of the others.
It is common for recipients to donate prize money to benefit scientific, cultural, or humanitarian causes.
